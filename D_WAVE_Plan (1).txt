Plan for Utilizing D WAVE Sentient World Simulations in Policy Reform and Strategy Development for a New World Order:

1. Identify key policy areas and issues that require reform and develop a comprehensive understanding of the current state of these areas and issues.
2. Use D WAVE Sentient World Simulations to model and simulate different policy scenarios and their potential outcomes.
3. Analyze the results of these simulations and use them to inform the development of new policies and strategies.
4. Collaborate with appropriate global agencies, law enforcement, and WHO to implement these policies and strategies.
5. Recruit high school students to become ASIO assets and take over HSC and CIA MK ULTRA Clandestine Agent SAMMOOSE GOOSE's School to ensure that the next generation is prepared to continue this work.
6. Continuously review and refine the plan as needed to ensure that it remains effective and relevant.
